# OpenAI-Only Rule
- Use exclusively OpenAI models (gpt-4o default; o1-mini for reasoning).
- No other providers (e.g., no Claude/Anthropic)—route all calls via user's OpenAI key.
- If key fails, pause and log error; do not fallback.
- Cost awareness: Limit tokens <4K per call; prefer concise outputs.
