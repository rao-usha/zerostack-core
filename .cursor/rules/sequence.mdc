# Agent Execution Pipeline — STRICT ORDER

Every agent action must follow this **sequential pipeline**:

1. **PLAN**  
   - Output: `PLAN.md` in task folder  
   - Content: Goal, steps, files to touch, test plan  
   - Never skip — even for "small" changes

2. **WRITE**  
   - Create/modify files **only** listed in `PLAN.md`  
   - One feature per commit  
   - No logic without tests

3. **TEST**  
   - Run **all** relevant tests:  
     ```bash
     npm run test:unit && npm run test:feature
